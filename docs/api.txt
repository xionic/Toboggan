Ultrasonic REST API Documentation for API Version 0.5

######################################################
# API Authentication:								 #
######################################################

There are 2 methods to authenticate:
1. Form based starting s session:
	Post "username" and "password" to rest.php&action=login. The password must be a sha256 hash of the password.

2. A HTTP header can be sent with each request to authenticate in the form:

	X-US-Authorization: method userStr|passStr

	where method is US-Auth1, userStr is the username base64 encoded, and passStr is a sha256 hash of the password encoded in base64

######################################################
# API Versions :							 		 #
######################################################

Every request must include an apiver={apiversion} argument or the request will be rejected. If the version sent by the client is unsupported a 
412 Precondition failed HTTP response will be sent.

######################################################
# API Keys :								 		 #
######################################################

Access to the REST api requires an apikey. Every request must include an apikey={yourapikey} argument or the request will be rejected.

######################################################
# Per user traffic limits							 #
######################################################

The traffic limits which can be configured per user ensure that in a time frame defined by the period of the limit, more traffic than that defined 
in the limit will not be transmitted to the client as a media stream. The limit will not be reset immediately after the period has expired. The time
at which the limit is reset depends on many factors and should not be relied upon. However, it can be relied upon that an exceeded limit will be reset
if a stream is requested after the period has elapsed.

######################################################
# Authenticated User ID Header						 #
######################################################

The API will send an HTTP response header 'X-AuthenticatedUserID' indicating the ID of the currently logged in user. 
This will be send with all requests except those made with the "login" method (i.e. action=login)
