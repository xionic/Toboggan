Ultrasonic REST API Documentation for API Version '''''0.58'''''

== Access to the API ==

Access to the API is via /''approot''/backend/rest.php

Arguments are to be sent as GET variables unless otherwise specified by the specific method documentation

Data returned by the API is in JSON format unless otherwise specified.

== API Authentication ==

There are 2 methods to authenticate:
# Form based starting a session:
#: Post "username" and "password" to <code>rest.php&action=login</code>. The password must be a sha256 hash of the password encoded in base64. This method does not require future requests to re-authenticate unless the session has expired.
# A HTTP header can be sent with each request to authenticate in the form:
#: <code>X-US-Authorization: method userStr|passStr</code> <br> where method is US-Auth1, userStr is the username base64 encoded, and passStr is a sha256 hash of the password encoded in base64


== API Versions == 		 

Every request must include an <code>apiver={apiversion}</code> argument or the request will be rejected. If the version sent by the client is unsupported a 
412 Precondition failed HTTP response will be sent.

== API Keys ==

Access to the REST API requires an apikey. Every request must include an <code>apikey={yourapikey}</code> argument or the request will be rejected.

== Authenticated User ID Header ==

The API will send an HTTP response header <code>X-AuthenticatedUserID</code> indicating the ID of the currently logged in user. 
This will be returned by the server with all responses except those made to requests with the "login" method (i.e. <code>action=login</code>)


== List of API methods exposed by the backend==

These are utilised by calling <code>rest.php?action=methodName&arg1=val1...</code>

===listMediaSources===
	'''Arguments:'''<br />

</pre>
	
===retrieveStreamerSettings===
'''Arguments:'''<br />
	None
	
Retrieves a data structure representing the backend Streamer settings. These can be altered/added to 
and sent back in the same format to the "saveStreamerSettings" action. The structure is of the form:
<pre>
[
	{
		  "fromExtensions":	"value",
		  "bitrateCmd":		"value",
		  "toExtension":	"value",
		  "MimeType":		"value",
		  "MediaType":		"value",
		  "command":		"value",
	}
	...
]
</pre>
	
===saveStreamersSettings===
'''Arguments:'''<br />
*settings - (POST) a json string representing the streamer settings to be saved in the following form:
<pre>
[
	{
		  "fromExtensions":	"value",
		  "bitrateCmd":		"value",
		  "toExtension":	"value",
		  "MimeType":		"value",
		  "MediaType":		"value",
		  "command":		"value",
	}
	...
]
</pre>
	
Saves streamer settings. The streamer settings on the server will be entirely replaced by those given here.
NOTE: if there are duplicate toExtension rows in the settings object, they must have the same MimeType and MediaType, or an error will be thrown.
e.g.
<pre>
	row1 ... toExtension: mp3, MimeType: audio/mp3, MediaType: a
	row2 ... toExtension: mp3, MimeType: audio/mp3, MediaType: v
</pre>
This example is invalid because the toExtension contains conflicting settings. toExtension's are unique and cannot have 
different MimeType or MediaType for the same toExtension. 

The same applies to rows with the same fromExtension's and differing bitrateCmd's

== A note on per-user traffic limits==

The traffic limits which can be configured per user ensure that in a time frame defined by the period of the limit, more traffic than that defined 
by the limit will not be transmitted to the client as a media stream. The limit will not be reset immediately after the period has expired. The time
at which the limit is reset depends on many factors and should not be relied upon. However, it can be relied upon that an exceeded limit will be reset
if a stream is requested after the period has elapsed.
